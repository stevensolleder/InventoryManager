# InventoryManager 

## Introduction
The **InventoryManager** API  simplifies inventory management by making it easy to add, update, view, and delete items along with their related details. Every item has a name, description, link, images and more. The API also lets you organize items into categories and rooms, adding or removing them as needed. When uploading files, built-in checks ensure security and proper file formats. The API includes validation to keep data organized and scans files for viruses to maintain safety. It also enforces file size and type limits to prevent unsupported uploads.
